    <p>This research project aims to gain a better understanding of student engagement with climate change learning and related activities within UCL, student wellbeing and student expectations regarding how Higher Education can better prepare students to live, work and study in a world impacted by climate change.</p>

    <p>We adopted a participatory approach to research following co-production principles and values. This means that student and academic researchers work together on all stages of the research process - from research design to data collection, analysis and the dissemination of findings and recommendations.</p>

    <p>You can browse this website to find out more about the research design and methods we have developed and check for updates on the research findings and how we have chosen to present them within UCL and to the wider Higher Education sector.</p>
