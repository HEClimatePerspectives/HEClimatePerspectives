  <p>This research project aims to gain a better understanding of student engagement with climate change learning and activities and student wellbeing within UCL, as well as students’ expectations regarding how Higher Education can better prepare students to live, work and study in a world increasingly impacted by climate change.</p>

  <p>We use a participatory approach to research informed by co-production principles and values. This means that student and academic researchers work together on all stages of the research process – from research design to data collection, analysis, and the dissemination of findings and recommendations.</p>

  <p>You can browse this website to find out more about the research design and methods and check for updates on the research findings and how we choose to present them within UCL and to the wider research community.</p>
