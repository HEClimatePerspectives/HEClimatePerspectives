# HE Climate Perspectives 🌍

This UCL Grand Challenge – Climate Crisis project aims to gain a better understanding of students’  
perspectives on how Higher Education can better prepare students by exploring their expectations, values and beliefs.

We adopted a **participatory co-production** approach to research; student partners are involved at all  
stages of the research process - from research design to data collection, analysis and the  
dissemination of findings and recommendations.
